# ISDC
Repository created for storing and documenting all code pieces involved in the development of the Illinois State Data Center Website.
The repository contains logic to use census bureau apis and extract the required data, in addition to preprocessing and cleaning to further use the data
in downstream reporting.

County profiles have been generated using exclusive python libraries and saved as <county_name>_county_profile.pdf
